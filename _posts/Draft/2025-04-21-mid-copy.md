(20points).

1. (10 points). Assume that $p$ is a prime number greater than 2. Prove that the polynomial  

    $$
    f (x) = x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + \cdots + x + 1
    $$

    is irreducible in the rational number field $ℚ$.

2. (10 points). For an integer coefficient polynomial

    $$
    f (x) = x^{n} + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} x + a_{n},
    $$

    the sufficient and necessary condition for $f (x)$ to have **(non-zero)** integer roots is that there are $2(n-1)$ integers $\{ b_i, c_i , \  i = 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ such that

    1. $a_i = b_i  +  c_i$, for $i = 1, \cdots, n-1$; and
    2. $\frac{1}{c_1} = \frac{b_1}{c_2} =  \frac{b_2}{c_3} = \cdots =  \frac{b_{n-2}}{c_{n-1}} =  \frac{b_{n-1}}{a_{n}}$.

(20 points).  

1. (10 points). Assume that $a,b ∈ ℂ$ are two complex numbers. Prove the following two subspaces of $ℂ[x]$,  

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & V_a=\{f(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x] \mid f(a)=0\}, \\[6pt]
    & V_b=\{g(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x] \mid g(b)=0\} ,
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    are isomorphic.
2. (10 points). Assume that $ε_1, ε_2, ε_3$ is a basis of the linear space $V$, and $f_1, f_2, f_3$ is the dual basis of $ε_1, ε_2, ε_3$. Let  

    $$
    α_1=ε_1+ε_2+ε_3,\quad {α}_2=ε_2+ε_3,\quad {α}_3=ε_3.
    $$

   1. Prove that $α_1, α_2, α_3$ is a basis of $V$;
   2. Find the dual basis of $α_1, α_2, α_3$ (using $f_1, f_2, f_3$ to represent).

(20 points). Suppose $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over a number field, and let $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_s$ be $s$ proper subspaces of $V$. Prove that

1. There exists some $α ∈ V$ such that $α ∉ V_1 ∪ V_2 ∪ \cdots ∪ V_s$;

2. There exists a basis of $V, ε _1, ε _2, \ldots, ε _n$, such that

   $$
   \left\{ε _1, ε _2, \ldots, ε _n\right\} ⋂ \left(V_1 ∪  V_2 ∪  \cdots ∪  V_s\right)=∅.
   $$

(15 points). Suppose $φ _1, φ _2, \ldots, φ_m$ are linear maps over the $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, such that  

$$
φ _i^2 = φ _i\quad  \text{and}\quad  φ _i φ _j = 0 \quad (i ≠ j, \ 1 ≤ i, \ j ≤ m).
$$

Prove that

$$
V=\operatorname{im} \varphi_1 ⊕ \operatorname{im} \varphi_2 ⊕ \cdots ⊕ \operatorname{im} φ_m ⊕ \bigcap_{i=1}^m \operatorname{ker} φ_i .
$$

(10 points). *You are encouraged to have a great amount of reading and thinking besides the classes. This problem is meant to test the your understanding.*
Please give a new theorem/question that has neither appeared in classes nor in our textbook, and then give a proof/solution to this theorem/question.
It can be a phenomenon you have summarized, a theorem in other books, or a theorem that is beyond what we have learned.
